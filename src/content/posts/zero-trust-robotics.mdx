Robots are no longer isolated lab curiosities—they’re deployed in hospitals, warehouses, and public spaces. Yet most robotic systems still operate on implicit trust models. This post explores how to apply zero-trust principles: device identity, least-privilege communication, and runtime attestation in ROS 2 and custom middleware stacks.
